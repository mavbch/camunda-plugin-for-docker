### Start and Clear Plugin for the Camunda Cockpit
---

This was a small school project that adds two button in the process/instances menu in the cockpit.
One to start instances of a process and another to clear all started instances of the process.

You can get the image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mavbch/camunda254) from dockerhub (or build/run it yourself) :rocket:.
